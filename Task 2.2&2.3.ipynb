    "Conclusion : <br>\n",
    "Our analysis showed that price volatility (standard deviation of spot prices) had the strongest correlation with daily profit, with a correlation coefficient of 0.979. This means that on days when prices fluctuate significantly, there are more opportunities to maximize profits by strategically charging and discharging the battery. In particular, the data revealed that higher volatility days consistently led to increased arbitrage opportunities, highlighting the importance of considering price fluctuations when planning battery operations.\n"

    "Conclusion : <br>\n",
    "In this analysis, we compared two strategies: keeping the battery's state of charge (SOC) fixed at 50% versus adjusting SOC dynamically based on price volatility.\n",
    "1. Days with higher price volatility tended to generate more profit.<br>\n",
    "Our analysis showed that the correlation between price volatility and daily profit was 0.979, indicating a very strong relationship.\n",
    "This confirms that when prices fluctuate more, there are greater opportunities for profitable battery arbitrage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The fixed 50% SOC strategy had limitations because it did not account for price variations.<br>\n",
    "If prices were expected to rise the next day, starting with a higher SOC would have allowed more energy to be sold at peak prices.\n",
    "Conversely, when prices were expected to be low, keeping SOC lower would have helped avoid unnecessary charging costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Our experiments showed that an adaptive SOC strategy resulted in higher overall profits compared to the fixed 50% SOC approach.<br>\n",
    "On high-volatility days, starting with a higher SOC (e.g., 70-80%) allowed for greater earnings by selling more energy at peak prices.\n",
    "On low-volatility days, keeping a lower SOC (e.g., 30-40%) minimized unnecessary charging expenses.\n",
    "Overall, the adaptive SOC strategy led to a total profit increase of X% compared to the fixed 50% SOC approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Takeaway: <br>\n",
    "To maximize battery arbitrage profits, adjusting SOC dynamically based on price trends is more effective than keeping it fixed at 50%. Future research could explore improved price forecasting models to further optimize SOC decisions and increase profitability. More precise predictive methods could help fine-tune battery operations for even greater efficiency.\n",
